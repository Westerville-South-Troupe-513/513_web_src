Westerville South High School Theatre Boosters Inc. is a nonprofit whose mission is to lend all possible support, both moral and financial, to the general theatre program and related activities of Westerville South High School.

For the 25-26 season, the theatre program at Westerville South will put on 4 full length shows - 2 musicals and 2 plays, one of which is done in a black box style. In addition, there are 2 full length student directed plays, 1 student written full length musical, 3 sets of 3 student directed one acts, and a student written and directed full length variety show. Westerville South's school year is always full of plenty for the theatre troupe to participate in. Because the theatre program is so robust, it is important to have a strong booster organization to help support and assist in any way necessary.
