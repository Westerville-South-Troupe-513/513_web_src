While the title is a classic that has spanned decades and entertained audiences of all ages, there is a real message about the human condition that resonates in us and is important to remember. Charlie is larger than life and goes for every laugh imaginable and just when you think it is going to fly off the rails we learn the lesson and discover the incredible heart behind this peculiar title. This one is for the part of us (big and small) that lives in the land of imagination. Itâ€™s gonna be great!
